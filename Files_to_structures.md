# Files to data structures

> Link between archive files to data structures in twitter-archive-reader module

### `verified.js`

You can check if archive owner is verified with the boolean `archive.user.verified`.

## GDPR archives: folders

This part will link GDPR archive directories data to `twitter-archive-reader`.

Folders in GDPR archives store **media data**, like tweet images, videos, direct messages and profile medias.

You can access medias with the `MediaArchive` instance, located on the `.medias` property of Twitter Archive Reader.
Some methods available on this object are made to facilitate access to tweet and DM medias. Those methods are
described in the **Dealing with medias** part of the wiki, please refer to it in order to learn more about them.

### Warning
In archives made between **June 2019** and **December 2019**, media files were zipped inside the archive.
In this case, `twitter-archive-reader` must extract the ZIP from the original archive to read its content.

This cause a huge overhead when first accessing selected media archive, and may be fatal for RAM-limited systems with very big archives.

### Mapping between folders and `MediaArchiveType` enumeration

An enumeration (`MediaArchiveType`) is available to reference each supported folder by `MediaArchive`.
Enumeration items are used with `.get()` and `.list()` methods.

```ts
enum MediaArchiveType {
  SingleDM, GroupDM, Moment, Tweet, Profile
}
```

You can import it as a component `twitter-archive-reader` package.
```ts
import { MediaArchiveType } from 'twitter-archive-reader';
```

Here's the folder list to enum reference.

- `direct_message_media`: **MediaArchiveType.SingleDM**

- `direct_message_group_media`: **MediaArchiveType.GroupDM**

- `tweets_media`: **MediaArchiveType.Tweet**

- `profile_media`: **MediaArchiveType.Profile**

- `moments_media`: **MediaArchiveType.Moment**

If other folders are present in the archive, they aren't accessible.

### `data/js/tweet_index.js`

For every item in tweet index array:

File name and var name are unaccessible.
All the related information to each year/month to tweet count is located in `archive.tweets.index`.

```ts

const index = archive.tweets.index;

// Index is organized from years to months to tweets IDs
if (2019 in index) {
  if (8 in index[2019]) {
    const tweet_count = Object.keys(index[2019][8]).length;
  }
